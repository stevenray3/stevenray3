## Hello there!

My name is **Steven ROLLET**  
I'm 19 and I'm a junior front-end web developer.

I'm looking for a job in webdesign or web development.

### About me

I'm passionate about web development because of it's infinite resources and it's forever changing state. It's also a way to help people start a new business online and get popular. I like helping people and contributing to projects.
I'm also a musician, composer and curious artist.  
I started playing guitar in 2015 and publishing music online in 2016. I still do, crafting some new tracks and songs, hoping one day I'll make music people will relate to, or feel the same as I did when creating it. I have always wanted to pursue that dream ever since.

### Studies

I have a DUT <abbr title="Design, development and communication">MMI</abbr> at the IUT Dijon, a two year technical degree in web development and multimedia.
I have a Baccalaur√©at in Science, where I studied Engineer Science.  
I went to the drama course during 3 years, which resulted in a huge confidence boost and made me more of an extrovert.
Although I'm a native French speaker, I speak English fluently and can manage apeaking a little bit German, but I know HTML5/CSS3/JS/PHP.
