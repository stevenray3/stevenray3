Welcome to my GitHub profile, have fun!

My name is **Steven ROLLET**  
I'm 18 and I'm mainly a front-end developer and a webdesigner.

Right now I'm working on my project, Ardoiz, and I'm looking for a job placement in webdesign or development.

### Overview

Currently second year in <abbr title="Design, development and communication">MMI</abbr> at the IUT Dijon, I'm also a musician, composer and curious artist.  
I'm passionate about web development because of it's infinite resources and it's forever changing state.

I love challenges!

I started publishing music in 2016 and I always wanted to do other things besides that ever since.

### Studies

I have a Baccalaur√©at in Science, with a specialisation in Engineer Science.  
I went to the drama course during 3 years, and that made me confident.
Although I'm a native French speaker, I fluently speak English and can manage apeaking a little bit German, but I know HTML/CSS/JS/PHP (who said those had to be spoken languages?).
